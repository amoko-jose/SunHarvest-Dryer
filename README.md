# SunHarvest Dryer (SHD)

The **SunHarvest Dryer** is an innovative solution that leverages solar energy to dehydrate and preserve various food items. This technology empowers communities, particularly in refugee settlements, to reduce post-harvest losses and improve food security. By constructing SunHarvest Dryers, we aim to foster sustainable practices, contributing to both economic growth and environmental conservation.

## Introduction

The SunHarvest Dryer harnesses the sun's power to preserve food, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional drying methods. This OER provides step-by-step instructions for building and using the dryer, promoting self-reliance and environmental sustainability.

## Principles of Operation

The SunHarvest Dryer operates by:
- **Heat Absorption**: The black interior surfaces absorb heat from the sun.
- **Ventilation**: Proper airflow is facilitated by vents to remove moisture.
- **Dehydration**: The heat and airflow work together to dry food items efficiently.
